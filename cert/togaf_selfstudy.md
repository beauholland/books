# Notes

## The four architectural domains of TOGAF

The four architectural domains of TOGAF. TOGAFs ADM process is specifically designed to accelerate workflow across four domains of enterprise architecture:

- Business architecture
  - Responsible for mapping the relationships between a business’s operational hierarchies, policies, capabilities, and initiatives.
- Applications architecture
  - Responsible for defining relevant applications to handle company data and the ways in which to implement and deploy these applications within the overall infrastructure.
- Data architecture
  - Responsible for defining the rules and standards to store and integrate data.
- Technical architecture
  - Defines platforms, service, and all surrounding technology components to serve as a reference for development teams.

## The TOGAF Architecture Development Model (ADM)

The TOGAF framework not only outlines the key components of an Enterprise Architecture through its four Architectural Domains, but it also provides a clear roadmap for how to create that architecture. This roadmap is known as the Architecture Development Method (ADM), and it is a nine-phase sequential process. The ADM guides organizations in developing their Enterprise Architecture.

**A** - Architecture Vision

**B** - Business Architecture

**C** - Information Security Architecture

**D** - Technology Architecture

**E** - Opportunities and Solutions

**F** - Migration Planning

**G** - Implementation Governance

**H** - Architecture Change Management
