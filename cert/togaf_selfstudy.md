# Notes

## The four architectural domains of TOGAF

The four architectural domains of TOGAF. TOGAFs ADM process is specifically designed to accelerate workflow across four domains of enterprise architecture:

- Business architecture
  - Responsible for mapping the relationships between a business’s operational hierarchies, policies, capabilities, and initiatives.
- Applications architecture
  - Responsible for defining relevant applications to handle company data and the ways in which to implement and deploy these applications within the overall infrastructure.
- Data architecture
  - Responsible for defining the rules and standards to store and integrate data.
- Technical architecture
  - Defines platforms, service, and all surrounding technology components to serve as a reference for development teams.

## The TOGAF Architecture Development Model (ADM)

The TOGAF framework not only outlines the key components of an Enterprise Architecture through its four Architectural Domains, but it also provides a clear roadmap for how to create that architecture. This roadmap is known as the Architecture Development Method (ADM), and it is a nine-phase sequential process. The ADM guides organizations in developing their Enterprise Architecture.

**Preliminary** 
- Scope the enterprise organizations impacted
- Confirm governance and support frameworks
- Define and establish the Enterprise Architecture team and organization
- Identify and establish Architecture Principles
- Tailor the TOGAF® framework and, if any, other selected architecture frameworks

**A - Architecture Vision**
- Establish the Architecture Project
- Identify stakeholders, concerns, and business requirements
- Confirm and elaborate business goals, business drivers, and constraints
- Evaluate capabilities
- Assess readiness for business transformation
- Define scope
- Confirm and elaborate Architecture Principles, including business principles
- Develop Architecture Vision
- Define the Target Architecture value propositions and Key Performance Indicators (KPİs)
- Identify the business transformation risks and mitigation activities
- Develop Statement of Architecture Work: secure approval

**B - Business Architecture** | **C - Information Security Architecture** | 
**D - Technology Architecture**
- Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
- Develop Baseline Architecture Description
- Develop Target Architecture Description
- Perform gap analysis
- Define candidate roadmap components
- Resolve impacts across the Architecture Landscape
- Conduct formal stakeholder review
- Finalize the architecture
- Create / update Architecture Definition Document

**E - Opportunities and Solutions**
- Determine / confirm key corporate change attributes
- Determine business constraints for implementation
- Review and consolidate gap analysis results from Phases B to D
- Review consolidated requirements across related business functions
- Consolidate and reconcile interoperability requirements
- Refine and validate dependencies
- Confirm readiness and risk for business transformation
- Formulate Implementation and Migration Strategy
- Identify and group major work packages
- Identify Transition Architectures
- Create the Architecture Roadmap & Implementation and Migration Plan

**F - Migration Planning**
- Confirm management framework interactions for Implementation and
- Migration Plan
- Assign a business value to each work package
- Estimate resource requirements, project timings, and availability / delivery vehicle
- Prioritize the migration projects through the conduct of a cost / benefit assessment and risk validation
- Confirm Architecture Roadmap and update Architecture Definition Document
- Complete the Implementation and Migration Plan
- Complete the architecture development cycle and document lessons learned

**G - Implementation Governance**
- Confirm scope and priorities for deployment with development management
- Identify deployment resources and skills
- Guide development of solutions deployment
- Perform Enterprise Architecture Compliance reviews
- Implement business and IT operations
- Perform post-implementation review and close the implementation

**H - Architecture Change Management**
- Establish value realization process
- Deploy monitoring tools
- Manage risks
- Provide analysis for architecture changemanagement
- Develop change requirements to meet performance targets
- Manage governance process
- Activate the process to implement change

**Requirements**
- Identify requirements and document them
- Baseline requirements
- Monitor baseline requirements
- Identify changed requirement; remove, add, modify, and re-assess priorities
- Identify changed requirement and record priorities;identify and resolve conflicts; generate requirements impact statements
- Assess impact of changed requirement on current and previous ADM phases
- Implement requirements arising from Phase H
- Update the Architecture Requirements Repository
- Implement change in the current phase
- Assess and revise gap analysis for past phases
